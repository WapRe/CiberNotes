<h2>Log Analysis</h2>
Where to find?
<ul>
  <li>Windows - Event Viewer</li>
  <li>Linux - /var/log</li>
  <ul>
    <li><i>auth.log, dpkg.log, syslog, kern.log</i></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Grep</h3>
<p>
  -i : insensitive search<br>
  -E : regular expressions (regex) <br>
  -r : recursive, you can use a directory <br>
  grep ".*\.zip$" : to look for a file, in this case, zip
</p>
<h2>Scanning Tools</h2>
<h3>Nmap</h3>
<p>
  nmap -sS MACHINE_IP : TCP SYN Scan; Get the list without completing the TCP three-way handshake and making the scan a little stealthier<br>
  nmap -sn MACHINE_IP : Ping Scan; Allows scanning without going deeper and checking for ports services etc <br>
  nmap -O MACHINE_IP : OS Scan; type of OS running <br>
  nmap -sV MACHINE_IP : Service Scan; Detecting Services. <br>
</p>
<h3>Nikto</h3>
Nikto is open-source software that allows scanning websites for vulnerabilities. It enables looking for subdomains, outdated servers, debug messages etc., on a website<br>
Can be used in terminal:<br>
nikto -host MACHINE_IP:port (or without port)<br>
<h2>Brute Force</h2>
<ul>Remote access protocols related:
  <li>SSH: Secure Shell. Remote login. It provides the user with a command-line interface (CLI) that can be used to execute commands.</li>
  <li>RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol; it is also known as Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) or simply Remote Desktop (RD). It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to access an MS Windows system.</li>
  <li>VNC: Virtual Network Computing. It provides access to a graphical interface which allows the user to view the desktop and (optionally) control the mouse and keyboard. VNC is available for <b>any system</b> with a graphical interface, including MS Windows, Linux, and even macOS, Android and Raspberry Pi.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hydra</h3>
<p>
  Standard format: <b>hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt server service -V</b>
  <ul>
    <li><b>-l username:</b> -l should precede the username, you should omit this option if the service does not use a username.</li>
    <li><b>-P wordlist.txt:</b> file or path to the list of passwords you want to try with the provided username. (Rockyou.txt)</li>
    <li><b>server</b> is the hostname or IP address of the target server.</li>
    <li><b>service</b> indicates the service in which you are trying to launch the dictionary attack. Such as <b>rdp, vnc, ftp, pop3 or any other protocol</b> supported by Hydra.</li>
    <li>Exemple: hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt MACHINE_IP ssh   or   hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://MACHINE_IP</li>
  </ul>
  Options you can use:
  <ul>
  <li>-V or -vV, for verbose, makes Hydra show the username and password combinations being tried.</li>
  <li>-d, for debugging, provides more detailed information about whatâ€™s happening. The debugging output can save you much frustration; for instance, if Hydra tries to connect to a closed port and timing out, -d will reveal this immediately.</li>
  </ul>
