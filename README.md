# Notes
Quick notes that I'll be taking as I progress in the field of cybersecurity and Python

I'm separating them by themes as I consider necessary.

A lot of the knowledge is from the Try Hack Me platform, and then completed with information from other rooms.

Everything in this repository is acquired from my own research and knowledge.

Feel free to interact.
