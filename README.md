# Notes
Quick notes that I'll be taking as I progress in the field of cybersecurity and Python

I'm separating them by themes as I consider necessary.

A lot of the knowledge is used from Advent Of Cyber 4 by Try Hack Me and then completed with information from other rooms.

Everything in this repository is acquired from the THM website, my own research, and my own knowledge.
